## C++ Maze Solver with SFML

This project is a C++ program that generates and solves mazes using the SFML library and the backtracking algorithm. Explore the maze generation process and find the optimal solution!

### About:
The Maze Solver with SFML project creates random mazes and finds their solutions using the backtracking algorithm. It provides an interactive way to visualize maze generation and pathfinding.

### Features:
- Maze generation using randomized algorithms.
- Maze solving using the backtracking algorithm.
- Visual representation of maze generation and solution pathfinding.
- Interactive controls with SFML graphics.

### Technologies Used:
- C++ programming language.
- SFML library for graphics and window management.

### How to Run:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peczyn/MAZE_PROJECT
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
